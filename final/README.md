# Get pretrained models
Please use the following commnad to get the pretrained models
``` bash
bash get_model.sh
```
- There are four models will be downloaded, including the model fine-tuning on the ganzin dataset and the model pretraining on the TEyeD dataset.

# Inference
After preparing the datasets and the pretrained models, use the following command to generate the predicted masks
``` bash
bash inference.sh
```
- Note: We set the parameters for the `public/S5` folder. If you want to test other subjects, please modify the script's config `--subject`.
- The predicted masks will be generated on the folder `public_mask` automatically.

# Training
- We have three models, including valid prediction model, segmentation w/ non-valid eyes model, and segmentation w/o non-valid eyes model. All models are pretrained on the TEyeD dataset [1], you can use the pretrained models provided by us to obtain the same results by fine-tuning the models on the ganzin dataset.
- Please use the following command to train these three models
``` bash
bash train.sh
```
- After training, models will be saved on the folder `checkpoint`.
